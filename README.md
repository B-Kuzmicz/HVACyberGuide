1. **Search Functionality**: The AI should be able to search through the PDF documents to find specific information. This could be based on keywords or phrases. For example, if a user asks about the function of a condenser in an HVAC system, the AI should be able to find and present the relevant information from the PDFs.

2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: The AI should be able to understand the context and intent of the user's question. This will allow it to provide more accurate and relevant answers. For example, if a user asks "What is the role of an evaporator?", the AI should understand that the user is asking about the function of an evaporator in an HVAC system.

3. **Document Summarization**: The AI should be able to summarize the content of the PDF documents. This will allow it to provide concise and easy-to-understand answers to the users' questions.

4. **Image Recognition**: Since the documents include diagrams, tables, and charts, the AI should be able to recognize and interpret these images. This will allow it to provide more detailed and accurate answers.

5. **User Interface (UI)**: The UI should be user-friendly and intuitive. It should allow users to easily ask questions and navigate through the app.

6. **Learning Capability**: The AI should be able to learn from its interactions with users. This will allow it to improve its performance over time.

7. **Multi-language Support**: If your target audience is global, consider adding multi-language support to cater to users from different regions.

8. **Accessibility Features**: Ensure your app is accessible to users with disabilities. This could include features like text-to-speech for visually impaired users or speech-to-text for users with hearing impairments.

9. **Feedback Mechanism**: Include a way for users to provide feedback on the AI's responses. This can help you improve the AI's performance and accuracy.

10. **Security and Privacy**: Ensure that the app complies with data protection regulations and respects user privacy. This is especially important if the app will be used in a professional or educational context.

Remember, the goal of your app should be to make it easier for users to find and understand the information they need. Good luck with your project!

It's also a good idea to check the availability of the name for domain registration and app store listings.

Also, consider the ease of pronunciation and spelling. A name that's easy to pronounce and spell can be more memorable and less confusing for your users. 

Lastly, you might want to consider how the name translates into other languages, especially if you plan to offer your app in multiple countries. You want to avoid names that might have negative or inappropriate connotations in other languages.
